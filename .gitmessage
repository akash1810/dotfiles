# Guidelines (from https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
#   1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#   3. Capitalize the subject line
#   4. Do not end the subject line with a period
#   5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
#   7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# Semantic Versioning:
#   MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
#   MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
#   PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
